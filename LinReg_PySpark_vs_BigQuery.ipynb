    "This project aims at exploring the differences in speed and accuracy between a linear regression model built on the 'chicago_taxi_trips' dataset available in Google BigQuery as a publicly available dataset. Basic Linear Regression with BigQuery ML will be performed and compared with Linear Regression with Pyspark ML with different number of nodes to determine how close in speed Pyspark ML can get to BigQuery ML and possibly how many worker nodes are needed for this speedup.\n",

    "## 3. Introduction to BigQuery and BigQuery ML\n",
    "\n",
    "Google BigQuery is a data warehouse which can store massive quantities of data. It allows users to query the data and perform analytics tasks on read-only big data. Data on Google BigQuery can easily be queried using simple SQL queries using the processing power of Google's infrastructure[1]. BigQuery can run queries on billions of rows of data in a matter of seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Google BigQuery runs on top of Dremel i.e, it is an implementation of Google's core technologies code named 'Dremel'[2]. Dremel is Google's software for running extremely fast SQL queries on large quantities of data. The basic difference between Dremel and BigQuery is that Dremel is used by the engineers, technicians, analysts etc working at Google whereas BigQuery is a public implementation of the Dremel technology meaning it is an externalisation of Dremel that is available to the public. So, the public can harness the capabilities of Dremel using BigQuery for their big data processing requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Google BigQuery's Public Datasets Program houses many publicly available datasets. The dataset being used in this project is one of these datasets. BigQuery has a perpetual free tier and allows 10 GB free storage and 1 TB data querying per month. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2018, Google announced a new feature of Google BigQuery called Google BigQuery ML. It allows users to perform Machine Learning in the BigQuery architecture itself so this means that the response time is very quick as is demonstrated in this project. As of now, BigQuery ML is still in its development Beta phase meaning that currently only Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are supported. However, BigQuery ML will go a long way to helping everyone (analysts, technicians) get into the field of Machine Learning since it uses simple SQL queries to build machine learning models and similar SQL queries for prediction and model evaluation. With BigQuery ML, the user need not have in-depth knowledge of Machine Learning in order to be able to leverage the power of machine learning in their analytics tasks. Anyone with knowlegdge of SQL can easily use BigQuery ML.[3]"

    "The Google BigQuery Connector for Apache Spark is used to read/write data from BigQuery[5]. This project first loads the data from BigQuery using the BigQuery Connector. Then, some basic data cleaning is performed in order to get the data into a suitable format for performing linear regression on it. Once this cleaned data is procured, linear regression in pyspark is performed four times - each time using different number of worker nodes. The time requirements of each are recorded. Also, the accuracy of the model is recorded.\n",

Doing a quick search in wikipedia about this[7], there are 4 main community areas in the city of Chicago: Central side, North side, West side and South side. Taxi cab companies use what is known as 'route based pricing' which is based on 'willingness to pay'. In other words, this means that the cab companies use localities to determine how much money people travelling in and around the locality can pay and use this information to set prices for different localities. People travelling in and around posh localities are more likely to be rich and will be more willing to pay higher prices than those who travel in and around poorer localities. \n",

From the Pearson Correlation matrix, we can tell that the all of the numerical variables have a positive correlation with the predictor. The correlation between trip_miles and trip_total seems quite low. However, the taxicab companies calculate the fares using distance as well as duration of travel along with a host of other variables. Thus, we will keep these variables in our model."

The OLS method aims at minimising the loss function $(y - \\beta_0 - \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\beta_ix_i)$ but this comes at the cost of overfitting the model. Overfitting means the model gets trained too closely to the data it learns from. \n",

We can reduce overfitting by penalising the minimisation of the loss function using regularisation methods such as the ridge and lasso regression which use the L2 and L1 norms respectively. In this project, we are using the Ridge regression algorithm which uses the L2 norm to penalise the loss function. The form of the Ridge regression is : $(y - \\beta_0 - \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\beta_ix_i) - \\lambda\\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\beta_i^2$.\n",

The numerical variables need to be standardised in order to reduce multicollinearity betweeen the interacting terms. If standarisation is not carried out, we risk missing statistically significant results as well as stand the risk of producing misleading results[14].\n",

So, we use onehotencoding in order to transform categorical variables into a format that works better with regression algorithms[15]. In pyspark, we first need to index the categorical variables before onehotencoding them. StringIndexers will encode the string categorical columns into a column of numeric indices. Onehotencoding will map this column of numeric indices into a column of binary vectors [16].\n"

    "#### Some background about linear regression in BigQuery ML\n",
    "For performing linear regression in BigQuery ML, basic knowledge of SQL is required. \n",
    "- The CREATE MODEL command creates the machine learning model. For performing linear regression, in OPTIONS, lin_reg needs to be specified. Various other parameters can be set and details about these parameters can be found at https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create. BigQuery ML doesn't require the user to onehotencode and standardise variables. This is done automatically under the hood. For more than 10,000 rows of data, BigQuery automatically uses batch gradient descent, hence for the purposes of this project, the optimize_strategy needs to be manually specified to normal_equation for normal least squares method as pyspark.ml does not have features for batch gradient descent[22]. \n",
    "- The ML.EVALUATE command evalutes the machine learning model and spits out various metrics to determine if the model is good or not. In linear regression, the results include the following : mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, mean_squared_log_error, median_absolute_error, r2_score and explained_variance. \n",
    "- The ML.PREDICT command is used to make predictions on the model. "

    "- Initially the size of the dataset is 40.43 GB. For simplicity's sake, I removed all null values from the interesting predictors. The size of the dataset after removing null values is 23.42 GB. More data cleaning resulted in the model being built on 5.04 GB of data which seems like a missed opportunity since so much of the data is missing. \n",
    "- Since the errors are high and the r2 values are low, linear regression does not seem to be a good model to fit on the data. Probably other machine learning techniques for regression might be more suited to predicting the trip cost in this case. As mentioned before, BigQuery ML is still in Beta phase and can only perform Linear and Logistic Regression at the moment, so for the purpose of this project, I have stuck with Linear Regression."

Also, the fact that it is currently in Beta phase does not work in its favour.

Hopefully, in the near future, Google will address these issues.[3]"

    "## 9. CONCLUSION\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims at showing how to perform machine learning on big data using two platforms and at comparing the differences between Pyspark ML and BigQuery ML. BigQuery ML is lightening fast and much easier to use than Pyspark ML. However, with great speed comes loss of flexibility and understanding. BigQuery ML is like a black box because a lot of the machine learning processes happen under the hood. The accuracies of both models are comparable as all the paramters that are fed in are similar. Pyspark ML speeds up with addition of new nodes. Even at the maximum of 5 number of nodes used to perform Pyspark ML, it is much slower than BigQuery ML. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Linear Regression model is used in this project. The model evaluators such as the R2 score (low) and Mean Squared Errors (high) indicate a poor model. Since BigQuery ML is in its nascent stage and only supports Linear and Logsitic Regression at this stage, linear regression has been used. More sophisticated regression models for example, ensemble methods like random forests might be better algorithms to use for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest gifts to analysts from Google, BigQuery ML has opened the world of machine learning to people who are not data scientists but have a fair knowledge of SQL. When BigQuery ML is released with full blown capabilities, it could replace a lot of the older machine learning platforms for big data due to its lightening fast speed. However, BigQuery ML is relatively expensive. One should weigh the costs of BigQuery ML, speed and flexibility requirements of their specific projects before deciding what platform to perform machine learning in. "
