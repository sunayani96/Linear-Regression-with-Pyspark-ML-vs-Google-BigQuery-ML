# Linear-Regression-with-Pyspark-ML-vs-Google-BigQuery-ML

This project aims at exploring the differences in speed and accuracy between a linear regression model built on the 'chicago_taxi_trips' dataset available in Google BigQuery as a publicly available dataset. Basic Linear Regression with BigQuery ML is performed and compared with Linear Regression with Pyspark ML with different number of nodes to determine how close in speed Pyspark ML can get to BigQuery ML and possibly how many worker nodes are needed for this speedup.

The chicago_taxi_trips dataset can be found at : https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?_ga=2.237940288.-1586404566.1547810022&project=sunayani&folder&organizationId&p=bigquery-public-data&d=chicago_taxi_trips&t=taxi_trips&page=table
